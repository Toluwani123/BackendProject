# BackendProject
This project was carried out using the Django Framework.
I was asked to Create a Login System which after Login is carried out, the user's name and email will display on the home page
TO run this project on your local device python 3.0 or above and django will need to be installed
By typing python manage.py runserver in terminal this project will be fit to use.
